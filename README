# Retrieve Data using Youtube API
This project shows how to use Youtube API to get video details. I searched for Elvis Presley videos. I used 2 API requests to get
the necessary information. Then, I converted the result to pandas dataframe in order to manupilate easly. Finally, I analysed videos
according to their features such as like counts, comments, and tags.
